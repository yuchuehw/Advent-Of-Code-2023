## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve coding puzzles and challenges. It's a great opportunity to improve your programming skills, explore new language features, and engage with a global community of developers. For more information and to participate, visit the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Solutions

- Each day's solution is organized in its own directory, named `day-01`, `day-02`, and so on.
- The solutions are implemented in Python.
- Additional explanations or insights may be provided in each day's directory if necessary.

## Folder Structure

The repository structure is as follows:

```plaintext
.
├── day-01
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
├── day-02
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── README.md
├── ...
└── README.md
```

## Usage

To run the solutions:

1. Navigate to the specific day's directory, e.g., `day-01`.
2. Run the Python script, e.g., `python solution.py`.
3. Input data for the day is stored in `input.txt`.

Feel free to adapt the code to your needs, experiment with different approaches, and share your improvements!

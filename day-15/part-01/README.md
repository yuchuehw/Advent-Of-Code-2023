## Prompt

The HASH algorithm is a way to turn any string of characters into a single number in the range 0 to 255. To run the HASH algorithm on a string, start with a current value of 0. Then, for each character in the string starting from the beginning:

    Determine the ASCII code for the current character of the string.
    Increase the current value by the ASCII code you just determined.
    Set the current value to itself multiplied by 17.
    Set the current value to the remainder of dividing itself by 256.

After following these steps for each character in the string in order, the current value is the output of the HASH algorithm.

So, to find the result of running the HASH algorithm on the string HASH:

    The current value starts at 0.
    The first character is H; its ASCII code is 72.
    The current value increases to 72.
    The current value is multiplied by 17 to become 1224.
    The current value becomes 200 (the remainder of 1224 divided by 256).
    The next character is A; its ASCII code is 65.
    The current value increases to 265.
    The current value is multiplied by 17 to become 4505.
    The current value becomes 153 (the remainder of 4505 divided by 256).
    The next character is S; its ASCII code is 83.
    The current value increases to 236.
    The current value is multiplied by 17 to become 4012.
    The current value becomes 172 (the remainder of 4012 divided by 256).
    The next character is H; its ASCII code is 72.
    The current value increases to 244.
    The current value is multiplied by 17 to become 4148.
    The current value becomes 52 (the remainder of 4148 divided by 256).

So, the result of running the HASH algorithm on the string HASH is 52.

The initialization sequence (your puzzle input) is a comma-separated list of steps to start the Lava Production Facility. Ignore newline characters when parsing the initialization sequence. To verify that your HASH algorithm is working, the book offers the sum of the result of running the HASH algorithm on each step in the initialization sequence.

For example:

rn=1,cm-,qp=3,cm=2,qp-,pc=4,ot=9,ab=5,pc-,pc=6,ot=7

This initialization sequence specifies 11 individual steps; the result of running the HASH algorithm on each of the steps is as follows:

    rn=1 becomes 30.
    cm- becomes 253.
    qp=3 becomes 97.
    cm=2 becomes 47.
    qp- becomes 14.
    pc=4 becomes 180.
    ot=9 becomes 9.
    ab=5 becomes 197.
    pc- becomes 48.
    pc=6 becomes 214.
    ot=7 becomes 231.

In this example, the sum of these results is 1320. Unfortunately, the reindeer has stolen the page containing the expected verification number and is currently running around the facility with it excitedly.

Run the HASH algorithm on each step in the initialization sequence. What is the sum of the results? (The initialization sequence is one long line; be careful when copy-pasting it.)


## Description

The script `main.py` implements a custom hash function and calculates the sum of custom hash values for messages read from a file. Each message is hashed using the custom hash function, and the script outputs the total sum of these hash values.

## Approach
This is a relatively simple problem. ALl you need is parse the input file and follow the instruction and design a simple hashing algorithm.

## Solution

The custom hash function `custom_hash` iterates over each character in the input string, adds its ASCII value to the hash result, multiplies it by 17, and takes the result modulo 256.

The main function, `calculate_sum_of_hashes`, reads messages from an input file, splits them by a comma, and calculates the sum of custom hash values for each message.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Input

The input is read from a file named `input.txt`. The file should contain messages separated by commas.

Example input file:
```
message1,message2,message3
```

## Output

The script will output the sum of custom hash values for all messages.
